### Description
- Solving the famous Cat versus Dog problem: given an image, use a CNN model to classify whether it is a dog image or a cat image.
- Utilize the '**datasets**' and '**transforms**' modules from the torchvision library for image preprocessing.

### Metrics Evaluation
- Model performance will be assessed based on **precision**, **accuracy**, and **recall** metrics.
- Metrics should be computed on the validation set.
- To meet project criteria, all three metrics must surpass 0.6.
